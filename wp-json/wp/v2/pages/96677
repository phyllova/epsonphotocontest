Shortly after arriving, I immediately noticed this branch in the water. It was clear to me that this would be the perfect foreground for my photo, as the Milky Way will also be in the right position. Since the conditions were initially not ideal for the Milky Way, due to the cloudy sky, I prepared myself for an unsuccessful night. But experience has shown that weather conditions can change quickly, so that a good photo can still be taken. Also that night I was lucky that the weather changed and I was able to photograph the shining night sky.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>In this portfolio there are 3 countries, 3 different motifs and 3 different conditions and yet they all have something in common: the The beautiful shining.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>From Daniel&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I was born in 1992 and come from Carinthia \/ Austria.

Here I am very much into hyperreal landscape photography, which distinguishes me from most Austrian landscape photographers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Landscape photography has become a huge part of my life, even if I don&#8217;t have as much time to invest as full-time landscape photographers.

It is the state that consists of around three hundred islands and most of them are uninhabited. One of them is particularly well-known: it is Eil Malk Island, a part of the Chelbacheb archipelago (the Rock Islands).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This coral island is covered with forests, measures 6 km long and 4.5 km wide and has 10 lakes on its surface. Even though they are connected to the ocean through cracks in the limestone, the outer world has had little impact on them and a unique ecosystem has evolved here. As a result, one of the lakes has become a home for jellyfish. There is no other place on the planet having such a great amount of them.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The lake appeared between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago. The first inhabitants were brought here from the ocean and the isolated character of this lake has subsequently resulted in a special evolutional way. There are only two jellyfish species in this lake: the golden jellyfish (Mastigias papua) and the moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) but they differ from those living in other waters worldwide and even in neighbouring lagoons. Biologists classify them as distinct species and continue to explore them.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The golden jellyfish has a rather unusual form: it is a \u201cdome\u201d with four tentacles. Lots of bright yellow jellyfish of different sizes fill the lake as if changing the colour of the water. Aurelia, in its turn, is transparent and has a very uncommon lifespan: instead of growing older, they are capable of reverting to the polyp stage. There is only one other \u201cimmortal\u201d jellyfish in the world, Turritopsis dohrnii.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The \u201cgolden\u201d inhabitants of Jellyfish Lake can live only in the upper layer: closer to the bottom, there is a lack of oxygen. They also perform daily migrations around the lake: in the morning they move from the centre of the western basin to the east; in the afternoon they return to the west and when the sun goes down, they again go back to the east and stay there overnight. They migrate counterclockwise, and there is a reason for these movements: jellyfish absorb dissolved nutrients from the water, prey on zooplankton and provide an equable exposure of the sunrays.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The moon jellyfish live in the opposite way. They rise to the surface of the water only at night when there are small crustaceans that jellyfish can eat. That\u2019s the reason Aurelia can\u2019t be found in the photographs, so the main models for taking pictures are the golden jellyfish.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The precise number of them can\u2019t be estimated: according to rough estimates, there are 2 millions of them! That\u2019s what makes this lake famous.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But there is a potential danger for a diver, as well. The point is that the lake is stratified into two layers. An oxygenated upper layer, the place where all inhabitants live, and a lower layer at the depth of 10-15 meters with a reduced oxygen content and lots of hydrogen sulphide, phosphorus and ammonia. This toxic environment is suitable only for rare \u201cextreme-loving\u201d bacteria and dangerous for people, so it is prohibited to dive that deep. The poisonous substances can get into the human body through the skin and cause serious health problems. Fortunately, the mixing of two different layers does not occur and the surface waters are safe for all living beings.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>That\u2019s what many tourists come here for: to swim in an outstanding wonderful lake.

With each rainy period the canvas is transformed. This canvas is actually a raft of toxic waste from a copper mine, located in the province of Huelva, Spain, which was captured by aerial shooting. These ephemeral formations will disappear with the next intense rains. I live only 1 hour away from this scenery, so I usually make a visit every week. There are always completely new structures and details that allow you to make countless abstractions, figurations, etc. I often have the feeling that an abstract expressionist painter has created a large canvas and that I am capturing fragments of this work of art with my drone.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;grid&#8221; text_align=&#8221;center&#8221; background_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; padding_bottom=&#8221;60&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_separator type=&#8221;normal&#8221; border_style=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>2021 RAW Planet Award<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;96666&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221; transition_delay=&#8221;.2&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1634936658917{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Marsel van Oosten, The Netherlands<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hidden Lake<\/em>, Atchafalaya Basin, Louisiana, USA<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This image was shot in the Atchafalaya Basin in Louisiana and features several cypress trees. I love these trees because they are simply stunning, especially when there is some Spanish Moss growing in them that dangles down from the branches. They can grow and survive in water which can result in otherworldly scenery like this. I visited this area in autumn to get the warm color palette. The only way to get here is by kayak because these swamps are too shallow for normal boats. Paddling here in complete silence is among my best wilderness experiences. When conditions are right, mist can form on the water, adding even more magic to the scenery.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_type=&#8221;row&#8221; use_row_as_full_screen_section=&#8221;no&#8221; type=&#8221;grid&#8221; text_align=&#8221;center&#8221; background_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; padding_bottom=&#8221;60&#8243; css_animation=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column][vc_separator type=&#8221;normal&#8221; border_style=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>2021 Curators Award<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image=&#8221;96563&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; qode_css_animation=&#8221;element_from_fade&#8221; transition_delay=&#8221;.2&#8243;][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1634425282089{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Max Rive, The Netherlands<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Mountain Dreamer<\/em>, Switzerland<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A view in mid-summer from 31450 m\/11320 ft over the Fieschergletscher with the Finsteraarhorn on the right (4,274 m\/14,000 ft).
